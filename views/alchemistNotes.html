    “When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
    <br>
    <br>
    Melchizedek gives Santiago two mystical stones, Urim and Thummim, to help him make decisions on his journey.
    <br>
    <br>
    Inspired by Melchizedek’s words, Santiago sells his sheep to pursue his dream.
